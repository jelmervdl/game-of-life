# Game of Life
Just me trying out and comparing different features of JavaScript using Game of Life.

Currently, there is Game of Life:
- implemented using (Web Workers)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers]
- vanilla, as efficient as I could come up with
- using hexagons instead of squares
